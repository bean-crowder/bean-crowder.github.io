## 🌿 Your Whole Life Coaching with Bean
Dedicated to Julie, who was always putting one foot in front of the other.

A space created by strength and inspired by love, honoring my sister Julie—a kind and radiant soul who always called me Bean.


## 💛 Welcome

Hi, I’m Christiane Crowder—also known as Bean by my beloved sisters. I’m a mom of two beautiful kids (and sometimes three, depending on how my husband’s acting—you know how it is).

Life has taken me through grief, heartbreak, obesity, healing, and self-discovery. And now, I offer what I’ve learned to others walking their own path.

If you're navigating stress, health struggles, hormone changes, relationships, self-worth—or simply trying to stay grounded—I’m here.
I offer more than advice. I offer my heart, my time, my presence, and a safe space to be fully you.
