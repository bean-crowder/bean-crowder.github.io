Hi, I’m Christiane Crowder, also known as Bean by my beloved sisters. I am a dedicated mother, supportive wife, and devoted friend, committed to nurturing strong relationships in every aspect of life.

Life has taken me through grief, heartbreak, obesity, healing, and self-discovery. And now, I offer what I’ve learned to others walking their own path.

If you're navigating stress, health struggles, hormone changes, relationships, self-worth, or simply trying to stay grounded, I’m here.
I offer more than advice. I offer my heart, my time, my presence, and a safe space to be fully you.
