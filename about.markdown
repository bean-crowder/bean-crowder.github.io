## 🌿 Your Whole Life Coaching with Cristiane Crowder
Dedicated to Julie and to my father, who always put one foot in front of the other.


## 💛 Welcome

Hi, I’m Christiane. My life has taken me through grief, anxiety, weight struggles, emotional eating, relationship challenges, and moments where I had to rebuild myself from the inside out. Those experiences became my training ground, the place where I learned how to rise, how to love myself again, and how to stay committed to growth even when life felt heavy.

Today, I bring that strength, compassion, and lived understanding into my coaching.
I am a coach who leads with my heart, present, grounded, and fully invested in the people I work with.

I help people who are navigating:
- Grief and loss
- Anxiety and overwhelming emotions
- Weight challenges and emotional eating
- Healing their relationship with food and body
- Relationship struggles and communication blocks
- Rebuilding confidence and self worth
- Setting goals and sticking to them
- Creating a life that feels grounded, loving, and aligned

I meet you exactly where you are with love, honesty, and tools that support your whole life, mind, body, and soul.

If you’re ready to feel supported, understood, and deeply encouraged, I’m here.
One step at a time. One choice at a time. One foot in front of the other, just like Julie, just like my dad, and just like you.
